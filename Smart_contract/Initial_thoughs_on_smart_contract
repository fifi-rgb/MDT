Event Organizer Issues Ticket (NFT):
├─ Mints NFT with metadata (seat, event, date)
├─ Sets original price in smart contract
├─ Defines royalty percentage (e.g., 2% of all future sales)
└─ Transfers NFT to original buyer's wallet

Seller Lists Ticket:
├─ Calls listTicket(tokenId, price) on smart contract
├─ Contract checks: owns ticket, not already listed, price not too high
├─ Contract emits "TicketListed" event
└─ Your website displays listing (reads from blockchain)

Buyer Purchases:
├─ Calls buyTicket(tokenId) with payment
├─ Smart contract executes atomic swap:
│   ├─ Validates buyer has enough funds
│   ├─ Transfers payment to seller (minus fees/royalties)
│   ├─ Transfers NFT to buyer's wallet
│   ├─ Invalidates old listing
│   └─ Records transfer in history
└─ All happens in single transaction - cannot fail partially

Venue Entry:
├─ Buyer shows QR code (generated from NFT in wallet)
├─ Venue scanner validates:
│   ├─ Reads NFT token ID from QR
│   ├─ Checks blockchain: does this wallet own this NFT?
│   ├─ Checks: has it been redeemed already?
│   └─ Marks NFT as "redeemed" on blockchain
└─ Entry granted
